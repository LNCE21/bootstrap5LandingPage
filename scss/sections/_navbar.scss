//Files imported with @use are called modules. To use mixins or variables of these modules, we have to call them using namespaces. By default, the namespace is the filename without the extension:
@use"../custom" as *;

.menu {
    background: $primary;

    li {
        padding: 0 .7rem;
    }

    a {
        color: $gray-900;
        text-transform: capitalize;
        font-weight: 600;
    }

}
